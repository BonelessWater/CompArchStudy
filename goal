I want to study for my computer architecture final exam tomorrow. It is cumulative. Look at the midterm exam and infer what questions the instructor might ask based on the new information. For instance, all of the questions in the midterm required calculation rather than just answering conceptual questions. Use the slides, homework's and midterm to create study materials. Create a holistic plan that is the most effective way of studying to cover all of m bases. It is a lot of content so we have to move slow.
